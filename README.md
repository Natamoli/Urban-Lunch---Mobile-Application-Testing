# 📱 Urban Lunch - Mobile Application Testing

## 📝 About the Project

This project focused on the quality assurance of Urban Lunch, a mobile application. I performed a full cycle of mobile testing, from analyzing requirements to executing tests on an Android environment. The goal was to ensure the app is intuitive, functional, and bug-free for mobile users.

## 🎯 What I Did

- **Requirement Analysis:** Reviewed the mobile app specifications to understand the user flow and business rules.
- **Test Design:** Created a detailed **Mobile Checklist** tailored for small screens and touch interactions.
- **Execution:** Tested the application using **Android Studio (Emulator)** and physical Android devices.
- **Bug Reporting:** Documented mobile-specific defects in **Jira**, focusing on UI/UX and functional stability.
- **Final Report:** Summarized the testing results to provide a clear view of the app's "Go/No-Go" status.

## 📱 Mobile Testing Skills Applied

- **Emulator Management:** Using Android Studio to simulate different mobile environments.
- **Mobile UX/UI:** Testing for "fat finger" syndrome, screen rotation, and small-screen layouts.
- **Android Specifics:** Checking back-button behavior, notifications, and system integration.
- **Functional Validation:** Ensuring the ordering and delivery process works perfectly on mobile.

## 🛠 Tools Used

- **Android Studio:** To run the mobile emulator and test different Android versions.
- **Jira:** To track and manage mobile-specific bugs.
- **Google Sheets:** For the mobile checklist and final test report.
